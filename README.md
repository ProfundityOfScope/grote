# Great Radio Observation Template Editor

Named after Grote Reber, this python code will help you in creating OPT style projects and testing them outside of the VLA OPT system, which can be (during even the best of times) slow and cumbersome. The objective is to have a system which can read in a target list and spit out a complete XML formatted description of the project, which can then be imported into the OPT and submitted without any other steps. 

Development is ongoing and patchy. Right now just use for reference, more to come soon
